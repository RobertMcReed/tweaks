# tweaks
This is a collection of enhancement tweaks. Most of them are specifically for MacOS, but the Canvas tweak is for Chrome, and should work on any platform.

### Canvas Calendar Tweak

By default, the Canvas calendar doesn't look great. There are stylistic components that make it hard to tell which assignments have been turned in, and which are still due.

This tweak modifies the CSS with the help of the chrome extension Stylebot. After defining a style sheet, your Canvas calendar will no longer be frustratingly unhelpful, but will instead be the helpful tool that it should be!
